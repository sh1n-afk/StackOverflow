# StackOverflow

This StackOverflow simulation is a comprehensive web application designed to mimic the core functionalities of the popular Q&A platform, StackOverflow. It provides a platform for users to post questions, share answers, and manage user profiles. Built using React for the frontend and Express for the backend, the application incorporates advanced features such as real-time interactions via Socket.IO, and robust data handling using MongoDB and Redis for database management. It also integrates Kafka for handling message queues, which enhances the appâ€™s scalability and performance. This project showcases my ability to construct complex full-stack applications that include real-time data processing, sophisticated state management with Redux, and a responsive, user-friendly interface.
